# Upgrading from 0.2 to 0.3
> [!WARNING]
> Upgrade articles do not cover every change, only the largest and most common to encounter. If you encounter a change that was
> undocumented, feel free to edit the article.  
> Additionally, the conversion examples in this article will only cover converting to immediate stages. See individual guides for use

## Adjusting Stages
The first (and easiest) requirement to upgrading is understanding when your mod should load. This can be simply mapped as:  

| Old stage       | New stage |
| :-------------- | :-------- |
| patcher         | patcher   |
| runtime         | setup     |
| *no equivalent* | runtime   |

> [!NOTE]
> Readers or loaders designed for assets that take a long time to load should be moved to runtime.  
> Almost anything that isn't a normal-sized text file (or serialized as such) should make use of this to reduce startup delay.  
> Convert your method to the corresponding stage first, then convert it to a runtime method.

## Adjusting the Manifest
There have been numerous adjustments to the manifest, easily demonstrated in a config change.  
Old:
```json
{
  "guid": "example.primary", // REQUIRED
  "version": "1.0.0", // REQUIRED
  "dependencies": {
    "example.secondary": "1.0.0"
  },
  "name": "Example Mod (Primary)",
  "authors": [ "Person 1", "Person 2", "Group" ],
  "sourceUrl": "https://example.org",
  "patcher": {
    "MyPatcher.dll": "assembly"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "MyRuntime.dll": "assembly"
  }
}
```

New:
```json
{
  "guid": "example.primary", // REQUIRED
  "version": "1.0.0", // REQUIRED, value is now SemVer
  "require": "0.3.0", // REQUIRED, new: SemVer of minimum version of Deli
  "dependencies": {
    "example.secondary": "1.0.0" // value is now SemVer
  },
  "name": "Example Mod (Primary)",
  "description": "A mod to demonstrate the manifest capabilities.", // new
  "authors": [ "Person 1", "Person 2", "Group" ],
  "source_url": "https://example.org", // renamed from "sourceUrl"
  "assets": { // new: contains all the stages and their assets
    "patcher": {
      "MyPatcher.dll": "deli:assembly" // value is now an asset loader ID
    },
    "setup": { // renamed from "runtime"
      "MyRuntime.dll": "deli:assembly" // value is now an asset loader ID
    },
    "runtime": { // new
      "MyActualRuntime.dll": "deli:assembly" // value is now an asset loader ID
    }
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Asset loaders are now identified by "mod guid:name", e.g. "example:cool_loader". Loaders provided by Deli are under the guid: "deli",
> e.g. "deli:assembly".

## Creating an Entrypoint
Every type of mutation of the framework now requires an entrypoint; there are no `Quick...Bind`s to automatically register things for you.
See [the patcher](../guides/patcher.md) or [the behaviour](../guides/behaviour.md) guide for information about entrypoints, though not much
as changed from 0.2 in this regard.

## Adjusting File Reads
The new process of accessing/reading files is much more complex, but grants many more powers.

Consider the following example from 0.2:
```c#
// Reads the string within "name.txt", if it exists
Option<string> nameOpt = mod.Resources.Get<string>("name.txt");

// Unwraps the option, throwing an exception if the file was not found
string name = nameOpt.Unwrap();
```

An example of reading during an immediate stage in 0.3 would be:
```c#
// Represents the file called "name.txt" in the root directory.
// A null file means that the file was not present.
// Be sure to validate that this is not null, or you WILL get NullReferenceExceptions!
IFileHandle? file = mod.Resources.GetFile("name.txt");

// The reader that can deserialize files to strings
ImmediateReader<string> reader = stage.ImmediateReaders.Get<string>();

// Reads the string within "name.txt"
string name = reader(file);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new process requires a @Deli.Stage instance in order to get the readers, or you must provide the readers yourself. The VFS itself
> cannot deserialize a file, like `IResourceIO`s used to.

The benefits are not apparent until you use typed handles, which automatically update and cache the deserialized result.  
An example of such, done during an immediate stage:
```c#
IFileHandle? file = mod.Resources.GetFile("name.txt");

ImmediateReader<string> reader = stage.ImmediateReaders.Get<string>();

// Creates a typed handle, which extends the functionality of the original handle
// Pass and store this in your code instead of the direct name
var typed = new ImmediateTypedFileHandle<string>(file, reader)
```

Then when you need the exact file contents:
```c#
// The string within "name.txt"
// It will invoke the reader if there is no cache or the file was updated since last caching
string name = typed.GetOrRead();
```

### JSON
JSON has been slightly adjusted as well.  
Old:
```c#
// Adds the JSON reader to the kernel
kernel.RegisterJson<MyJsonType>();

// Option<MyJsonType> is now supported in IResourceIOs
```

New (any stage):
```c#
// Returns the JSON reader for that type
// Multiple invocations are safe
ImmediateReader<MyJsonType> reader = stage.RegisterJson<MyJsonType>();

// Use the immediate reader like any other
```

## Adjusting Asset Readers
Readers have the same purpose, but they have changed by a large percent:
- Now a delegate (was single method interface)
- Now takes a @Deli.VFS.IFileHandle (was `byte[]`)

Consider an old @"System.String?text=string" reader:
```c#
[QuickUnnamedBind]
class StringReader : IAssetReader<string>
{
    public string ReadAsset(byte[] raw)
    {
        // Convert the raw file contents to a string
        return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(raw);
    }
}
```

Converted to an immediate reader:
```c#
// Name does not matter
// Static, because the method does not require any state
public static string ReadString(IFileHandle file)
{
    // Open a stream to the raw file contents, similar to how we were provided a byte array before 
    using var raw = file.OpenRead();
    // Wrap the raw content in a text reader
    using var text = new StreamReader(raw);
    
    // Read the contents to a string
    return text.ReadToEnd();
}
```

> [!TIP]
> If your reader method needs state from its old type, then keep the type! Your non-static reader method can still be assigned to a
> reader collection.

Then, add the reader to an immediate reader collection:
```c#
// Allows anyone to use the reader
// If a reader already exists for the type, a warning is logged and the new reader is ignored
stage.ImmediateReaders.Add(ReadString);
```

## Adjusting Asset Loaders
Like its sibling, the reader, the loader has changed in form but not purpose:
- Now a delegate (was a single method interface)
- Now takes a @Deli.Stage (or more specific; was `IServiceKernel`)
- Now takes an @Deli.VFS.IHandle (was `string`)

For example, an old loader:
```c#
[QuickNamedBind("cool_number")]
class CoolNumberAssetLoader : IAssetLoader
{
    public void LoadAsset(IServiceKernel kernel, Mod mod, string path)
    {
        // Read an integer from the path given (file), and throw if it does not exist
        int n = mod.Resources.Get<int>(path).Unwrap();
        
        DoSomethingReallyCool(n);
    }
    
    private void DoSomethingReallyCool(int n)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

Versus a new setup loader:
```c#
class CoolNumberAssetLoader
{
    // Name does not matter
    public void LoadAsset(SetupStage stage, Mod mod, IHandle handle)
    {
        // Ensure the handle is a file (not a directory)
        if (handle is not IFileHandle file)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Cool number loading requires a file handle.", nameof(handle));
        }
        
        // This was already covered in the file access section
        ImmediateReader<int> reader = stage.ImmediateReaders.Get<int>();
        int n = reader(file)
        
        DoSomethingReallyCool(n);
    }
    
    private void DoSomethingReallyCool(int n)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> If you require multiple files for one loader, you can pattern match to @Deli.VFS.IDirectoryHandle instead of @Deli.VFS.IFileHandle. Then,
> simply access the files within the directory.

Then, add it to the loader collection:
```c#
// Allows anyone to use the reader
// If a reader already exists for the type, a warning is logged and the new reader is ignored
stage.SetupAssetLoaders[Source, "cool_number"] = new CoolNumberAssetLoader().LoadAsset;
```

> [!NOTE]
> The above example assumes you are in a @Deli.Patcher.DeliModule or @Deli.Setup.DeliBehaviour, in which case `Source` means the @Deli.Mod that the plugin originated from.
