# Deli Article Index
Greetings! Welcome to the ~~devlog~~ article tab! Each entry in this tab is hand-written and categorized:
- Preparing a Mod: instructions to making an empty mod, which is filled throughout the system guides
- System Guides: shows how to make various parts of a plugin (assembly loaded by Deli)
- Upgrading Mods: instructions for upgrading mods to new releases

Do note that the programming articles are very "to the point." They assume you have prior experience with C# and are familiar with modding
concepts, much of which are present and explained in the BepInEx documentation. If you wish for more to be explained, just ask us on
Discord. If you're super cool, you can even add to the documentation yourself.
